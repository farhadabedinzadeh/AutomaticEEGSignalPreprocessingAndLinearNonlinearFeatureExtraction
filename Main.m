
% In this Script A suitable Butterworth band-pass filter (0.5â€“60 Hz) was employed
% to eliminate out-of-band noise in this code. In addition, a 50 Hz notch filter 
% was utilized to eliminate the remaining line noise. To make it easier to track  
% future results, we normalized the entire database.                                       
% In the step of feature extraction, linear and nonlinear univariate features, 
% as well as nonlinear multivariate features, were extracted from EEG signals. 
% Individual recording channels and five frequency sub-bands (Delta,Theta, Alpha
% , Beta and Gamma) underwent spectral analysis of average power.
% On the basis of the Kaiser window, five Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters 
% were created to split the original signals into five subbands.
% ------------------------------------------
% Linear Features :Delta Average Band Power , Theta Average Band Power ,
% Alpha Average Band Power , Beta Average Band Power , Gamma Average Band Power
% Theta To Beta Ratio(TBR) 
% ------------------------------------------
% Nonliner Features : Sample Entropy , Shannon Entropy , Dispersion Entropy
% , MultiScale Sample Entropy
